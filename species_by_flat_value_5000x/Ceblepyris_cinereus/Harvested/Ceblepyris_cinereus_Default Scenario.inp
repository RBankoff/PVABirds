Extinction defined as no males or no females.

Inbreeding depression with a genetic load consisting of 
  6.29 total lethal equivalents per individual, of which
  50% are due to recessive lethals,
  and the remainder are lethal equivalents not subjected to removal by selection.

Populations:

  Population1


Reproductive System:

  Polygyny, with new selection of mates each year
  Females breed from age 1 to age 10
  Males breed from age 1 to age 10
  Maximum age of survival: 10
  Sex ratio (percent males) at birth: 50

Correlation of EV between reproduction and survival = 0.5

EV sampled from binomial distributions.
