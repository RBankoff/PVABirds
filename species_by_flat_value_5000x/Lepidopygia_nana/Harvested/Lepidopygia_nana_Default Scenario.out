In 5000 simulations of Default Scenario for 100 years:
  44 went extinct and 4956 survived.

This gives a probability of extinction of 0.00880 (0.00132 SE),
  or a probability of success of          0.99120 (0.00132 SE).

44 simulations went extinct at least once.

Of those going extinct,
    mean time to first extinction was 50.98 years (5.63 SE, 37.36 SD).
