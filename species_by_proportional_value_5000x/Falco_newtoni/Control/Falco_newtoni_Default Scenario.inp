Extinction defined as no males or no females.

Inbreeding depression with a genetic load consisting of 
  6.29 total lethal equivalents per individual, of which
  50% are due to recessive lethals,
  and the remainder are lethal equivalents not subjected to removal by selection.

Populations:

  Population1


Reproductive System:

  Polygyny, with new selection of mates each year
  Females breed from age 1 to age 9
  Males breed from age 1 to age 9
  Maximum age of survival: 9
  Sex ratio (percent males) at birth: 50

Correlation of EV between reproduction and survival = 0.5

EV sampled from binomial distributions.

  Percent of adult males in the pool of breeders: 100
  Normal distribution of brood size with mean: 2.5 with SD: 1

  Female annual mortality rates (as percents):
    Age 0 to 1:    35.5340145 with EV(SD): 10
