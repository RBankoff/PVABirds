In 5000 simulations of Default Scenario for 100 years:
  4871 went extinct and 129 survived.

This gives a probability of extinction of 0.97420 (0.00224 SE),
  or a probability of success of          0.02580 (0.00224 SE).

4871 simulations went extinct at least once.
Median time to first extinction was 77 years.

Of those going extinct,
    mean time to first extinction was 76.88 years (0.13 SE, 8.97 SD).
